### Install and run locally (Skipped this part if you had the dependencies and text editor installed already): 

I was unable to write instructions on how to install locally at this time (because pip install -r requirements.txt did not work). For future projects, I will take time to look into AWS or other cloud platforms to showcase the result. 
Run `git clone https://github.com/chihieuwe/cs50-final.git` to clone this project to your computer.
